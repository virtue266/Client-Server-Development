In the development process it is important to create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
When writing code, it is important to make sure the code has descriptive variable names as well as comments to help enhance readability.
Integrating the CRUD method helps to create a program that can communicate effectively with the frontend of a database. This helps in facilitating
future updates or changes to the database without a need for significant modifications to the database. Using the CRUD module also helps because the program can be
repurposed for different projects which saves a lot of time and effort in the development process.
As a computer scientist, I think solving problems means breaking down hard or complex tasks and trying compartamentizing each task into smaller and managable tasks. Its important to analyze 
the program's requirements as well as trying to come up with efficient solutions.
In trying to work on the Graviose Salvare projects, I tried my best to first understand the requirements that were being asked. There was definitely a lot of trial and error. I think as a 
developer it is important to not be embarrassed to ask questions and try to get help from others. I feel like coding is a never ending learning process.
